      <p>
        Crystal water bottles are simply glass water bottles embedded with
        natural crystal or gemstone chunks in their interior. Crystal water
        bottles are completely safe and non-toxic, and are designed to be
        sustainable and re-used again and again. Youâ€™ll find crystal water
        bottles fitted out with a range of different crystals known for health
        and healing properties, from rose quartz and clear quartz to amethyst
        and amazonite.

        The idea behind crystal water bottles is to imbue the water inside with
        the energy of the specific crystal soaking within. Different crystals
        are used for different healing or spiritual purposes. People have long
        been using crystals as a part of their meditation or spiritual rituals
        for centuries. For example, rose quartz is often used to attract love,
        while amethyst is known for strength and healing. Drinking this
        crystal-infused water allows you to benefit from the energy and
        intentions of your chosen crystal. So which crystal water bottle is the
        best fit for you?
